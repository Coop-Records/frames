### Coop Records Frame Generator

Coop Records developed a tool to easily create recurring Frames for songs on Sound.xyz.

The Frame Generator lets an admin create a Frame that points to a specific song on Sound.

We use the Frame Generator daily at Coop Records - allowing users on Farcaster to easily collect songs on Sound without leaving the feed.

Under the hood - the Frame Generator creates a unique output by pasting in a contract address along with a field to identify the ability to collect limited and unlimited editions of each track.

In total - the Frame Generator has been used to create over 100 Frames for Coop Records songs - estimated to have driven close to 5,000 mints.

### Evolution of the Generator

At inception - we were mainly using Frames to sponsor free mints [sponsor free mints](https://example.com).

Users were able to "claim" a fixed number of free editions with mint costs sponsored by Coop Records.

Over time - we migrated to support both limited and unlimited edition minting when transaction support went live.

From there - we allowed teams like Hume to use our Frames for their artists Angelbaby and Deathpixie.

Today - the Frame Generator is an essential part of the Coop Records work flow and is posted multiple times a day on the [@cooprecs account on Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/cooprecs).
